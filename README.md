# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The functionality of the event tracking app that I choose to develope was required to check usernames and passwords against the database when the user attempted to log in. If the user has never logged into the application before, I had to ensure that the user could create a new login and password and the users credentials needed to be save to a table in the database. The core functionality of the event application is to create a database shell and display that database’s information on a user’s screen using a grid. This also required functionality for users to read, add, update, and delete events in the database. Lastly, I had to develop code that prompts users for permission to send SMS messaging notifications and functions based on their response. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The basic UI requirements of the event tracking application I choose to develope was to design a UI which included a login screen, signup screen, notification screen, and an event screen that displayed events in a grid view.  

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach to the development process was to incrementally write new code and frequently test as I progressed through the design and functional requirements. I started by developing the UI and UX components than began adding the functional components of the application. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my code by using the device emulator in Android Studio. This helped me find errors in my code early on and allowed me to refine the application as I worked through the requirements. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My biggest challenge when developing the app was setting up the event database and creating the corresponding functions that allowed users to update particular events. I had to come up with intuitive ways that allowed the user to navigate these features and execute them in a user-friendly manner.   

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The UI/UX deisgn was hands down my favortie part of working on this project. I have an interest in frontend development so bring all the UI components together and creating a smooth user experience was a lot of fun. For this reason, I spent a lot of my time tweaking things to get the UI just the way I wanted it.
